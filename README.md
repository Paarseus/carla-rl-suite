## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

The development of autonomous driving systems represents one of the most challenging applications of artificial intelligence, requiring the integration of perception, planning, and control in complex, dynamic environments. While real-world testing remains essential, the costs and safety risks associated with training learning-based systems on actual vehicles necessitate sophisticated simulation environments.

CARLA (Car Learning to Act) has emerged as a leading open-source platform for autonomous driving research, offering photorealistic rendering, accurate physics simulation, and comprehensive sensor modeling. However, integrating CARLA with modern reinforcement learning frameworks requires careful engineering to handle the complexity of multi-modal sensory data, continuous control spaces, and the inherent challenges of sim-to-real transfer.

### 1.2 Project Objectives

This project aims to bridge the gap between CARLA's simulation capabilities and the requirements of reinforcement learning research by developing a comprehensive training environment that:

1. Provides a standard Gymnasium interface compatible with popular RL libraries
2. Implements modular architecture enabling rapid experimentation with different sensors, rewards, and scenarios
3. Ensures efficient data flow between CARLA's client-server architecture and RL training loops
4. Facilitates reproducible research through configurable scenarios and deterministic execution
5. Scales from single-agent training to potential multi-agent scenarios

### 1.3 Technical Approach

Our solution employs a manager-based design pattern where each major subsystem is encapsulated within a dedicated manager class. This architectural decision promotes separation of concerns, enabling independent development and testing of components while maintaining clean interfaces between subsystems. The environment leverages CARLA's Python API for simulation control and implements the Gymnasium interface for RL compatibility.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Architectural Overview

The system architecture follows a hierarchical design with clear separation between simulation management, sensor processing, action handling, and reward computation. At the core, the Environment class orchestrates interactions between specialized managers, each responsible for a specific aspect of the simulation.

```
Environment (Gymnasium Interface)
├── Connection Manager (CARLA Server Interface)
├── Hero Manager (Ego Vehicle Control)
├── Sensor System
│   ├── Sensor Manager (Factory)
│   ├── Sensor Interface (Data Collection)
│   └── Sensor Implementations
├── Traffic Manager (NPC Orchestration)
├── Observation Manager (State Processing)
├── Action Manager (Control Mapping)
└── Reward Manager (Objective Function)
```

### 2.2 Design Principles

The architecture adheres to several key design principles that ensure maintainability and extensibility:

**Modularity**: Each manager encapsulates a single responsibility, minimizing interdependencies and enabling component reuse. This modularity facilitates unit testing and allows researchers to modify specific aspects without affecting the entire system.

**Abstraction**: The sensor system employs an abstract base class hierarchy that enables uniform handling of diverse sensor types while accommodating type-specific processing requirements. This abstraction layer simplifies the addition of new sensors or modifications to existing ones.

**Synchronization**: The environment ensures temporal consistency between sensor readings, vehicle states, and world updates through careful management of CARLA's tick mechanism and queue-based data collection.

**Normalization**: All observations undergo normalization to ensure stable training dynamics. Position coordinates are normalized relative to starting positions, velocities are scaled to reasonable ranges, and angular measurements are bounded to prevent discontinuities.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Connection Management

The ConnectionManager class serves as the primary interface to the CARLA server, handling initialization, version compatibility, and cleanup operations. Upon instantiation, it establishes a client connection with configurable timeout parameters and validates server availability.

```python
class ClientConnection:
    def connect(self) -> Tuple[Optional[carla.Client], Optional[carla.World]]:
        self.client = carla.Client(HOST, PORT)
        self.client.set_timeout(TIMEOUT)
        self.world = self.client.get_world()
```

The manager implements comprehensive actor cleanup to prevent memory leaks during extended training sessions. This functionality proves critical when running thousands of episodes, as residual actors can accumulate and degrade performance.

### 3.2 Hero Vehicle Management

The HeroManager oversees the lifecycle of the ego vehicle, from spawning to sensor attachment and control application. The manager supports flexible spawn point configuration, allowing researchers to specify exact starting positions or utilize CARLA's predefined spawn points with random selection.

Vehicle configuration is externalized through a dedicated configuration file that specifies the blueprint (vehicle model) and attached sensors. This design enables rapid experimentation with different vehicle types and sensor configurations without code modifications.

The spectator camera positioning system automatically tracks the hero vehicle, providing visual feedback during development and debugging. The third-person perspective maintains a fixed offset behind the vehicle, adjusting orientation to match the vehicle's heading.

### 3.3 Sensor System Architecture

The sensor system represents one of the most complex components, implementing a factory pattern for sensor creation and a queue-based system for data collection. This architecture addresses several challenges inherent in CARLA's asynchronous sensor callbacks.

#### 3.3.1 Sensor Interface

The SensorInterface class manages sensor registration and data buffering through thread-safe queues. It distinguishes between continuous sensors (cameras, LiDAR) that produce data every tick and event sensors (collision, lane invasion) that trigger only upon specific occurrences.

```python
class SensorInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        self._sensors = {}  # Continuous sensors
        self._data_buffers = queue.Queue()
        self._event_sensors = {}  # Event-based sensors
        self._event_data_buffers = queue.Queue()
```

The dual-queue system prevents event sensor data from blocking continuous sensor retrieval while ensuring all sensor data from a single tick can be collected atomically.

#### 3.3.2 Sensor Factory

The SensorManager implements a factory pattern that instantiates appropriate sensor classes based on type specifications. This design enables the addition of new sensor types through simple extension of the factory method without modifying existing code.

#### 3.3.3 Sensor Implementations

Each sensor type inherits from a base class hierarchy that defines common interfaces while allowing specialized data parsing:

- **Camera Sensors**: Convert raw CARLA image buffers to NumPy arrays with appropriate color channel ordering
- **LiDAR Sensors**: Parse point cloud data into structured arrays containing position and intensity information
- **Event Sensors**: Handle asynchronous triggers for collisions and lane invasions with frame-based deduplication

### 3.4 Traffic Generation

The TrafficManager creates realistic traffic scenarios by spawning NPC vehicles and pedestrians throughout the simulation environment. The implementation leverages CARLA's Traffic Manager API to coordinate NPC behavior while providing extensive configuration options.

Key features include:
- Configurable vehicle and pedestrian densities
- Safe vehicle filtering to exclude accident-prone models
- Hybrid physics mode for performance optimization
- Synchronous operation support for deterministic replay

The traffic configuration is externalized, allowing researchers to define scenario complexity without code modifications. Parameters include vehicle count, pedestrian count, speed variations, and behavioral attributes.

### 3.5 Observation Space Design

The observation space combines multiple information sources to provide the RL agent with comprehensive environmental awareness. The design balances information richness with computational efficiency.

#### 3.5.1 State Vector Components

The hero state vector comprises ten normalized values:
- **Control State** (4 values): Current steering, throttle, brake, and speed
- **Spatial State** (3 values): Relative position (x, y) and heading angle
- **Dynamic State** (2 values): Velocity components (x, y)
- **Safety State** (1 value): Binary collision indicator

#### 3.5.2 Navigation Information

Navigation features provide lane-relative positioning:
- **Lateral Deviation**: Distance from lane center (normalized 0-5 meters)
- **Angular Alignment**: Angle between vehicle heading and road direction (normalized ±π)

The navigation system employs waypoint queries to determine the nearest lane center and road direction, using geometric calculations to compute deviations.

#### 3.5.3 Visual Perception

Camera observations deliver 300×400 RGB images from configurable viewpoints. The default configuration includes front, rear, left, and right cameras, with an optional top-down view for debugging. Image processing maintains consistent color ordering and data types for compatibility with standard computer vision libraries.

### 3.6 Action Space and Control

The action space implements a 2D continuous control scheme that maps directly to driving inputs:

```python
Action Space: Box(shape=(2,), low=[-1, -1], high=[1, 1])
- action[0]: Steering angle [-1, 1]
- action[1]: Acceleration/Braking [-1, 1]
```

The ActionManager translates these normalized values to CARLA's VehicleControl structure, handling the separation of throttle and brake commands. Positive acceleration values map to throttle application, while negative values engage braking.

Optional action smoothing prevents unrealistic instantaneous control changes, implementing an exponential moving average filter:

```python
smoothed_action = α * previous_action + (1 - α) * current_action
```

### 3.7 Reward Engineering

The reward function represents a critical component for successful policy learning, encoding desired driving behaviors through carefully weighted components. Our multi-objective reward function balances safety, efficiency, and comfort.

#### 3.7.1 Reward Components

**Speed Maintenance** (weight: 1.0): Encourages maintaining a target speed of 25 km/h using a Gaussian reward curve. This component penalizes both excessive slowness (impeding traffic) and dangerous speeds.

**Lane Keeping** (weight: 2.0): The highest weighted component emphasizes lane discipline through linear penalties based on lateral deviation. Severe penalties apply when exceeding 2-meter deviations.

**Collision Avoidance** (weight: -100.0): Implements immediate severe penalties for any collision detection, with additional penalties if episodes terminate due to crashes.

**Forward Progress** (weight: 1.0): Rewards distance traveled to encourage exploration and prevent stationary policies. Only active when vehicle speed exceeds 2 km/h to avoid rewarding sliding or pushing.

**Driving Smoothness** (weight: 0.5): Penalizes abrupt control changes exceeding thresholds (0.3 for steering, 0.5 for acceleration), promoting passenger comfort and mechanical sympathy.

**Road Alignment** (weight: 1.0): Encourages maintaining appropriate heading relative to road direction, with severe penalties for angles exceeding 45 degrees.

#### 3.7.2 Episode Termination

Episodes terminate under several conditions:
- Collision detection
- Excessive lane deviation (>4 meters)
- Successful completion (>100 meters traveled)
- Maximum timestep limit (truncation)

Termination bonuses or penalties adjust final rewards based on success or failure modes.

## 4. Technical Challenges and Solutions

### 4.1 Synchronization Complexity

CARLA's client-server architecture introduces synchronization challenges when coordinating multiple sensors with world updates. Our solution implements a queue-based collection system with timeout handling to ensure all sensors report data from the same simulation tick before proceeding.

### 4.2 Performance Optimization

Initial implementations suffered from performance bottlenecks in image processing and data transfer. Optimizations include:
- Minimal data copying through careful NumPy array management
- Efficient color space conversions using vectorized operations
- Selective sensor activation based on training requirements

### 4.3 Observation Normalization

Raw CARLA observations span vastly different scales (positions in meters, velocities in m/s, angles in radians), causing training instability. Our normalization scheme maps all observations to comparable ranges while preserving relative magnitudes and directional information.

### 4.4 Reward Function Stability

Early reward formulations produced sparse or conflicting signals that hindered learning. The current design ensures continuous reward signals with clear gradients toward desired behaviors while avoiding local optima through careful component balancing.
